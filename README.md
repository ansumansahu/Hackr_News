# Hackr_News

The main idea is to fetch the top tech news of the day. The project is based on web scraping using python module Beautiful Soup 4 from which we can collect the required data from the ycombinator news webpage and convert the data into a JSON file. We create a report out of it to grab the top tech news of the day and sort them according to the number of votes.
